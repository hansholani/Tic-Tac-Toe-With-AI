# TIC-TAC-TOE

A Java program implementing the game of 'Tic Tac Toe'. You can play against another person or AI with **three** difficulty levels (easy,medium,hard).

The keywords during input are - user, easy, medium, hard, exit.

**HOW TO PLAY :** 

Your input needs to have three words - "*start user/easy/medium/hard   user/easy/medium/hard*" 

**start** is a keyword to indicate that you want to play. The following two words specify the players. Maintain a space between the words. You can pit the AI levels against each other or even against itself!

Once you enter the correct parameters, the program prompts you to enter the coordinates of the board you want to mark. The coordinate system of the board is as the following - 

(1,3) (2,3) (3,3)

(1,2) (2,2) (3,2)

(1,1) (2,1) (3,1)

Enter your choice by typing the x coordinate and pressing enter and then the y coordinate.

Once a game is finished you can play it again with different parameters. If you want to stop the game, enter - *exit*.

The code for the 'hard' difficulty level is based on the **minimax theorum**.

I took up this project to practice and implement object oriented programming. Have fun playing!
